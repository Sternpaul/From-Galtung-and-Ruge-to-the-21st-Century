Anyone can report, share and find information online at any time. Consequently, 62% of U.S. adults get their news through social media (Gottfried  and  Shearer,  2016).  In this thesis, online news articles and tweets about the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 are compared. We analyse the linguistic characteristics of tweets with regard to news values. A mixture of manual and automatic methods made it possible to annotate the news values which are mostly drawn from Harcup and Oâ€™Neill (2017). The findings show that all of the following news values can be identified in the corpus: Negativity, Eliteness, Meaningfulness, Timeliness, Magnitude, and Follow-up. The rResults also suggest that for news articles, as well as for tweets, news values are still relevant today. Negativity is the most prominent news value in the corpus, while Magnitude is not used at all in headlines and is rarely used in tweets. Moreover, tweets from the corpus were compared to earlier tweets, which show that tweets about the Russian invasion were more newsworthy than tweets in January dealing with different topics.
